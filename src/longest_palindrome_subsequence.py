def longest_palindrome_subsequence(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string.
    
    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting 
    some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string to find the longest palindromic subsequence
    
    Returns:
        int: Length of the longest palindromic subsequence
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    Space Complexity: O(n^2)
    
    Examples:
        >>> longest_palindrome_subsequence("bbbab")
        4
        >>> longest_palindrome_subsequence("cbbd")
        2
