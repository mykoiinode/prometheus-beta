def longest_common_subsequence(A: str, B: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the longest common subsequence between two strings.
    
    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence 
    by deleting elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    
    Args:
        A (str): First input string
        B (str): Second input string
    
    Returns:
        str: The longest common subsequence
    
    Examples:
        >>> longest_common_subsequence("ABCDGH", "AEDFHR")
        'ADH'
        >>> longest_common_subsequence("", "ABC")
        ''
